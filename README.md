# Statistical Physics Projects

This repository contains a series of Python projects developed during my Statistical Physics class as part of my Physics major. The projects focus on computational approaches to solving problems in statistical mechanics, utilizing Monte Carlo methods, random walk simulations, and statistical distribution analysis.

## Projects Overview:

### 1. Random Walk Simulation (TPC1)
- **Objective**: Simulate the random motion of particles and analyze the mean square displacement (MSD) as a function of time.
- **Key Concepts**: Diffusion processes, random walks, and their statistical properties.
- **Highlights**: 
  - Simulated the random movement of particles over varying time steps.
  - Calculated and visualized the MSD to study diffusion behaviors.

### 2. Monte Carlo Simulations (TPC2)
- **Objective**: Apply Monte Carlo methods to simulate the behavior of physical systems, with a focus on the Ising model.
- **Key Concepts**: Monte Carlo techniques, energy autocorrelation functions, and phase transitions.
- **Highlights**: 
  - Implemented Monte Carlo simulations to explore energy states in the Ising model.
  - Analyzed the autocorrelation of energy as a function of Monte Carlo time.
  - Investigated the impact of altering the system's dimensionality.

### 3. Statistical Distributions in Physics (TPC3)
- **Objective**: Analyze statistical distributions relevant to physical systems and study how they evolve over time.
- **Key Concepts**: Probability distributions, statistical analysis, and computational simulations.
- **Highlights**: 
  - Implemented and visualized various statistical distributions.
  - Analyzed how these distributions relate to physical phenomena and their role in statistical mechanics.

## Features of the Repository:
- **Python**: All simulations and analysis were performed using Python, leveraging libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, and Numba for optimized performance.
- **Computational Methods**: The projects emphasize the use of computational techniques to understand complex physical systems that are otherwise difficult to model analytically.
- **Visualization**: The notebooks include rich visualizations to help illustrate key statistical properties and behaviors of physical systems.
